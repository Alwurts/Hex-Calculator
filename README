PWA Hexadecimal, Octal, Decimal and Binary numbers calculator and converter.

One of the main goals of this project is to make it into a progessive web app were it can function as an offline app on any smartphone.
Made with Bootstrap 5 for styling, HTML and Javascript for the functionality of the app.
The interface is mobile first but can still be used perfectly on a desktop or tablet, thanks to a responsive layout.


I took some UI inspiration from here https://dev.to/zxcodes/simple-calculator-with-dark-mode-545c
